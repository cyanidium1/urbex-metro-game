You can play on your dekstop throw online emulator on https://appetize.io/app/5h7zcl6atwycld4xctiredtgpq?device=pixel7pro&osVersion=13.0&scale=100&orientation=landscape
But recommended to download and play on mobile device cos on emulator some features don't work and animations are slow.
My first mobile game on Android using React Native, TailwindCSS and other stuff I don't remember. Here you can explore Kyiv Subway and participate in your own-made adventure story!
